## Name origin

Dekart is named after French mathematician Ren√© Descartes (French: [ Å…ône deka Åt], Latinized: Renatus Cartesius). Descartes was the name of a French family surname derived from the word des chartes, meaning "of the charts"; this was a reference to the family's involvement in the creation of maps and globes.
